a) Agile development is good with small cross functional teams and for teams that want or need constant collaboration with customers. For teams that are larger or who have customers who cannot be in contact, agile development does not work as well.
b) Product Owners responsibilities include more overarching issues like setting the direction of the team and dealing with releases and stakeholders. Contrastingly, Scrum Master responsibilities include setting up things like JIRA, adding the tools, and managing the sprints so they have more influence over the team itself.
