a) Agile development is good with small cross functional teams and for teams that want or need constant collaboration with customers. For teams that are larger or who have customers who cannot be in contact, agile development does not work as well.
b) Product Owners responsibilities include more overarching issues like setting the direction of the team and dealing with releases and stakeholders. Contrastingly, Scrum Master responsibilities include setting up things like JIRA, adding the tools, and managing the sprints so they have more influence over the team itself.
c) The 3 types of meetings are: The Sprint Planning Meeting - This meeting is to plan stories for the upcoming sprint, move them from the backlog to the sprint, and start the sprint; The Daily Scrum Meeting - A short meeting that happens everyday, team members will talk about any issues they've hit; Sprint Retrospective Meeting - This meeting happens at the end of the sprint, it includes moving unfinished stories to backlog and closing the sprint.
d) An epic is the largest task type that can be broken up into stories. A story is a software requirement that you can describe within a few sentences. A bug is a small unit of work, generally used to block the progress of a story as issues come up. A task is a specific step that needs to be completed on the road to completing a story.
